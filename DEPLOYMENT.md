# SwiftFormat Vercel Deployment Guide

## Database Requirements for Vercel

**Answer: NO DATABASE REQUIRED** for basic operation. Here's why:

### Current Architecture (Database-Free)
- **File conversion**: Serverless functions process files in `/tmp` directory
- **Session storage**: In-memory storage (resets per serverless function)
- **File tracking**: Handled client-side with temporary progress tracking

### What Works Without Database:
✅ File upload and conversion
✅ Progress tracking during conversion
✅ File download after processing
✅ All UI components and navigation
✅ Complete user experience

### Optional Database Use Cases
If you want to add these features later, you'd need a database:
- **Conversion history**: Track user's past conversions
- **User accounts**: Login/registration system
- **Analytics**: Usage statistics and metrics
- **Rate limiting**: Per-user conversion limits

### Recommended Vercel-Compatible Databases (If Needed)
1. **Neon PostgreSQL** (Serverless, free tier)
2. **PlanetScale MySQL** (Serverless, free tier)
3. **Supabase** (PostgreSQL with real-time features)
4. **Vercel Postgres** (Native integration)

### Current Deployment Steps for Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "SwiftFormat ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Import project from GitHub
   - Framework: "Other" (Vite handles the build)
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`

3. **Environment Variables (None Required)**
   - App works out of the box
   - Optional: Add analytics keys later

4. **Serverless Function Configuration**
   ```json
   // vercel.json (optional optimizations)
   {
     "functions": {
       "server/index.ts": {
         "maxDuration": 300
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Performance Optimizations for Serverless
- Files processed in `/tmp` directory (Vercel-compatible)
- Conversion timeout: 5 minutes max
- File size limit: 100MB
- Memory optimization for large files

### Summary
SwiftFormat is designed as a **stateless serverless application** that works perfectly on Vercel without any database. The conversion process is ephemeral and doesn't require persistent storage of user data or conversion records.
